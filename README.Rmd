# consonance

Consonance testing in R

[![Status](https://travis-ci.org/tkonopka/consonance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/tkonopka/consonance)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tkonopka/consonance/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/tkonopka/consonance)

'Consonance' means [accord or agreement](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/consonance).
This R package associates the term 'consonance testing' to the process of 
determining that a dataset is compatible with predefined criteria. This type of 
testing can be used, for example, to determine if a new dataset should proceed
to statistical analysis or if a new dataset satisfies the assumptions built
into a trained model. 

Consonance testing is related to unit testing and argument testing. The 
distinction is that consonance testing is relevant during data analysis rather 
than during software development. Accordingly, the `consonance` package 
provides a syntax and features that are geared toward interactive uses and 
toward pipelines. 


## Installation

The package can be installed through github. 

```{r installation, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(devtools)
install_github("tkonopka/consonance")
```

## Usage

For a minimal usage example, consider a small data frame with a character-class
 column (id) and a numeric-class column (value).

```{r example_data}
example_data <- data.frame(id=c("a", "b"), value=c(1, 2), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
example_data
```

The package can be used to create a suite of tests.

```{r suite}
library(consonance)
suite <- consonance_test("id column character", is.character, .var="id") +
  consonance_test("value numeric", is.numeric, .var="value")
suite
```

The data can then be evaluated against the suite.

```{r validate_good}
# with default settings, validation of consonant data is quiet
validate(example_data, suite)
# logging can be activated to provide verbose messages
validate(example_data, suite, logging.level="INFO")
```

When the data object does not meet the consonance criteria, the validation
step provides log messages and halts execution.

```{r validate_error, error=TRUE}
validate(example_data[, "id", drop=FALSE], suite)
```

The package vignettes explain more package features, including:

 - using consonance suites within pipelines (with `%>%`)
 - toggling testing on/off
 - setting importance levels for individual test conditions
 - using `checkmate` and custom functions in consonance tests
 - attaching consonance suites to models (e.g. `lm`, `glm`, etc.)
 - reporting results into log files

Supplementary vignettes describe further topics:

 - advanced use of consonance testing for model objects
 - consonance validations in batch



## Related work

Several other R packages handle testing, argument checking, and data
validation. Some are listed here with a brief description.

 - [checkmate](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate/) -
 collection of fast data-checking functions; can be used
 together with `consonance`.
 - [assertthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertthat/) -
 framework for data testing; provides friendly error messages
 - [assertr](https://github.com/ropensci/assertr) -
 framework for data testing; geared toward dplyr pipelines.
 - [validate](https://github.com/data-cleaning/validate) -
 comprehensive framework for data testing; provides detailed feedback
 on errors; overlaps with `consonance` with a different syntax

A comparison of these packages in terms of performance is provided
in a vignette, `performance.Rmd`.
