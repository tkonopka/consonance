## Introduction

Consonance means [accord or agreement](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/consonance).
Package `consonance` uses this term in the context of data analysis to
convey that a dataset passes a set of criteria and that, for example, the
dataset can progress to statistical analysis. The package aims to facilitate
tracking and checking quality control criteria by providing a set of
convenience functions that are straightforward to apply on arbitrary data and
to incorporate in existing analysis pipelines.

Quality control in data analysis can be thought of in terms of individual
components, or in terms of how those components interact with one another.
In software development, unit testing is an effective technique for tracking
that functions or packages perform their tasks correctly. The `testthat`
package is a leading toolkit in this regard in the R ecosystem. When working
with data, packages like `assertthat`, `checkmate`, and `assertr`, among others,
offer varying combinations of features. `assertthat` and `checkmate`
focus on testing individual variables. `assertr` in contrast also provides
tools to test entire datasets, for example for outliers. In addition, these
packages are quite flexible and can be extended in many ways. But the use of
quality controls in everyday analysis is still not as commonplace as
unit-testing is in software development, and this may be in part due to the
usability of the available tools.

Package `consonance` provides an alternative framework for building suites
of tests on datasets. Its focus is on grouping tests into suites, which
can be easily set up, maintained, and applied on data. Other features
include the ability to attach test to model objects, define tests at varying
levels of severity, and log outcomes. The framework can be thought of as a
layer for managing `assertthat` or `checkmate` tests. Or, it
can be thought of as an alternative syntax for `assertr` test chains.

The next section in this vignette contains an [overview](#overview)
of the package; this serves to introduce the syntax and show minimal
working examples. The following section with the
[user's guide](#guide) provides more details on all the
package features. The section on [use cases](#usecases) shows templates
for three different ways to apply the package in practice. These scenarios cover software
development as well as data analysis. A separate vignette quantifies the
cost of incorporating consonance testing in terms of running time.
